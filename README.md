jQuery-ListMenu
===============

This plugin allows a web developer or designer to easily convert an 'ordinary' list of HTML items into a compact, letter-based dropdown menu control that displays the list items in a fly-out menu that can be styled to suit any design. Great for creating snazzy navigation for product lists, lists of businesses, contact lists, anything you can think of.
